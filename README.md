# FOSWEC2

This repository has the latest code for operation of the FOSWEC2 device.  Operation really only requires the Simulink folder, however the setup files for the EtherCAT network (TwinCAT folder) and motor drives (DriveWare folder) are included.  A Reports directory has related documentation.
