	- flap shafts
	- high power cables and bulkheads
	- low power cables and bulkheads
	- ethernet cables and bulkheads
	- non-stainless fasteners on enclosure connection
- Removal
	- flap integrated load cells
	- flap integrated encoders
- Repair 
	- enclosure penetrations for instruments removed or consolidated
- Combining
	- low power and ethernet cable and bulkheads into a replacement single cable
- Removal and re-installation of all electronics in submerged enclosure to allow for enclosure machining
- Creation 
	- shore-side electrical stand on wheels for efficient storage and cable management
- Dry checkout of all systems
	- Application of reference signals on inverted flaps (ramps, sine, multisine, chirp)
	- Damping feedback checkout with manual flap actuation

# Flaps
New flaps were fabricated by the CMTD shop.  Changed from closed cell foam based design to a hollow weldment with the 
same nominal dimensions.  If we have any trouble with flaps leaking, we can fill with foam.  New flap dimensions are 
shown in the table below.  All dimensions in meters.


| width | depth1 | depth2 | height |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 0.743 | 0.061  | 0.120  | 0.576  |
