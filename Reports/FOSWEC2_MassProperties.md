# Introduction

This report documents the efforts in characterizing the mass properties of the FOSWEC2



---

# Flaps
Initial mass properties are estimated through Solidworks CAD models provided by the OSU CMTD shop.

The origin of the CAD model is located at the geometric center of the shaft.  Note the orientation of the CAD model with the Y-axis up and X-axis along shaft dimension.
